            <p>
                I’m proud to introduce my theory of induction, a systematic, rigorous method of proving generalizations from observation.
                In this short summary, I’ll indicate the essential features and benefits of my theory to motivate you to
                <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/inductica/home" target="_blank">read the book.</a>
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Like other objectivist philosophers, I conceptualize a generalization as a proposition of the form, “All S is P.”
                For example, “all metals conduct electricity.” Since most important scientific conclusions are generalizations, a
                method for proving generalizations is critical for achieving certainty in the sciences. My theory can be used to
                prove new discoveries and to formulate an inductive proof of past discoveries. Proof of past discoveries will give
                scientists certainty and clarity in many established conclusions and will uncover flaws in foundational beliefs
                accepted in the past. The immediate application and testing ground for my theory is to overhaul the flawed
                foundations of modern physics and use the clarified context of knowledge to break the stagnation in that field.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Proof Through Inductive Narrative</h3>
            <p>
                Inductive proof must proceed in a proper order. One must reason only with direct observation and ideas that have
                been proven by a chain leading back to direct observation. My theory of induction proves conclusions in the form
                of a story following a possible process of discovery, the observations and reasoning steps forming a plot where
                each discovery is made possible by discoveries made earlier. Inductive proof requires that one reason with one’s
                full context of knowledge; stories aid the mind in keeping track of this total in the form of a plot. Further,
                stories provide a natural framework for maintaining logical order; characters in the narrative cannot come to a
                conclusion until they have made the required observations and reasoning steps, they cannot test a hypothesis until
                they have observed evidence for it. Violations of logical order are experienced by the reader as plot holes.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Proper Conceptualization Justifies Generalizations</h3>
            <p>
                What proves a generalization? The view of many objectivists, including
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logical-Leap-Induction-Physics/dp/0451230051" target="_blank">
                    Leonard Peikoff,
                </a>
                is that a generalization is proven by grasping a causal connection. E.g. “Balls are round, roundness requires
                that an object roll when it is pushed, therefore balls roll.” This kind of reasoning does not prove a
                generalization, it simply kicks the can down the road. Such proofs always reason from some existing
                generalization, in this case, “balls are round,” which itself must be proven.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we form a concept, its distinguishing characteristics are generalizations. When we conceptualize
                roundness as a distinguishing characteristic of “ball,” we implicitly form the generalization, “all balls are
                round.” These generalizations must be proven because man can err when forming concepts. Although
                concepts for perceptual-level existents like “ball” are rarely flawed, conceptualization of higher abstractions
                is not always so easy. The faulty mainstream concept of selfishness packages together 1. concern for one’s
                own interests and 2. disregard of others. Such a concept leads to false generalizations like, “People concerned
                chiefly with their own interests will steal when they can get away with it.” Causal connections on their own do
                not prove generalizations because they rely on the validity of the concepts they reason from.
            </p>
            <p>
                What validates concepts then? When a conceptual framework is flawed, it will prevent the grasp of certain
                facts. Those with the mainstream concept of “selfish” will struggle to grasp that stealing is self-destructive,
                not selfish, even when you get away with it. In contrast, learning the objectivist concepts “selfish” and
                “parasite” brings this fact into sharp focus. The purpose of concepts is to effectuate a grasp of the known
                facts. A conceptual framework is validated when it is shown to form a non-contradictory grasp of the full set of
                known facts in one’s context of knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                When this standard is met, the generalizations implicit in distinguishing characteristics are proven. Statements
                of the form “all S is P” are justified by the fact that P is part of what it means to be S. My theory provides
                detailed norms for crafting such frameworks. Once this is achieved, generalization by enumeration becomes
                possible so long as the new generalization integrates with one’s existing conceptual framework.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Inference: The Method of Going Beyond the Senses</h3>
            <p>
                I have indicated how to prove generalizations, integrations of known facts, but how do we validly apprehend
                facts to begin with? There are two ways: direct observation and inference from direct observation. When a
                plastic rod is rubbed with a cloth, it will attract bits of paper. Scientists concluded that the rod has a new
                property (charge). That property is inferred from earlier principles—that entities act according to their
                properties and that new properties imply new constituent entities. Such inferences, from Mill’s methods to novel
                reasoning techniques, are grounded in a clear system of fundamental concepts and principles provided by my
                theory.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Certainty Through Top-Down Integration</h3>
            <p>
                To understand induction, one must distinguish “bottom-up” logical order (inductive proof) from “top-down”
                integration (like Euclid’s Elements or OPAR). In OPAR, broadest principles (e.g. moral standard) are set first,
                then narrower ones (virtues) derive from them. This final integration—the crown of inductive proof—
                facilitates certainty by letting the scientist see every concept in light of all conditioning facts. My theory
                gives explicit norms for building these hierarchies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Preview the Future</h3>
            <p>
                My ambition for this theory of induction is to enable certainty in the sciences. By following these
                procedures and standards, scientists can understand nature with unprecedented clarity and confidence. To
