            <p>
                I’m proud to introduce my theory of induction, a systematic, rigorous method of proving generalizations
                from observation. In this short summary, I’ll indicate the essential features and benefits of my theory
                to motivate you to read the book.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Like other objectivist philosophers, I conceptualize a generalization as a proposition of the form,
                “All S is P.” For example, “all metals conduct electricity.” Since most important scientific conclusions
                are generalizations, a method for proving generalizations is critical for achieving certainty in the
                sciences. My theory can be used to prove new discoveries and to formulate an inductive proof of past
                discoveries. Proof of past discoveries will give scientists certainty and clarity in many established
                conclusions and will uncover flaws in foundational beliefs accepted in the past. The immediate
                application and testing ground for my theory is to overhaul the flawed foundations of modern physics
                and use the clarified context of knowledge to break the stagnation in that field.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Proof Through Inductive Narrative</h3>
            <p>
                Inductive proof must proceed in a proper order. One must reason only with direct observation and ideas
                that have been proven by a chain leading back to direct observation. My theory of induction proves
                conclusions in the form of a story following a possible process of discovery, the observations and
                reasoning steps forming a plot where each discovery is made possible by discoveries made earlier.
                Inductive proof requires that one reason with one’s full context of knowledge (more on this below);
                stories aid the mind in keeping track of this total in the form of a plot. Further, stories provide a
                natural framework for maintaining logical order; characters in the narrative cannot come to a conclusion
                until they have made the required observations and reasoning steps, they cannot test a hypothesis until
                they have observed evidence for it. Violations of logical order are experienced by the reader as plot holes.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Proper Conceptualization Justifies Generalizations</h3>
            <p>
                What proves a generalization? The view of many objectivists, including Leonard Peikoff, is that a
                generalization is proven by grasping a causal connection. E.g. “Balls are round, roundness requires
                that an object roll when it is pushed, therefore balls roll.” This kind of reasoning does not prove a
                generalization; it simply kicks the can down the road. Such proofs always reason from some existing
                generalization, in this case, “balls are round,” which itself must be proven. You might object that we
                don’t need to prove this, that roundness is just part of what it means to be a ball, but this misses the
                fact that concepts are objective.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we form a concept, its distinguishing characteristics are generalizations. When we conceptualize
                roundness as a distinguishing characteristic of “ball,” we implicitly form the generalization, “all balls
                are round.” These generalizations must be proven because man can err when forming concepts. Although
                concepts for perceptual-level existents like “ball” are rarely flawed, conceptualization of higher
                abstractions is not always so easy. The faulty mainstream concept of selfishness packages together
                1. concern for one’s own interests and 2. disregard of others. Such a concept leads to false generalizations
                like, “People concerned chiefly with their own interests will steal when they can get away with it.” If a
                concept contradicts itself the way “selfish” does, any generalizations made by connecting the nature of
                its units to its actions will not be generally true. Causal connections on their own do not prove
                generalizations because such connections rely on the validity of the concepts they reason from.
            </p>
            <p>
                What validates concepts then? When a conceptual framework is flawed, it will prevent the grasp of certain
                facts. Those with the mainstream concept of “selfish” will struggle to grasp that stealing is
                self-destructive, not selfish, even when you get away with it. In contrast, learning the objectivist
                concepts “selfish” and “parasite” brings this fact, and many others, into sharp focus. The purpose of
                concepts is to effectuate a grasp of the known facts. As a result, a conceptual framework is validated
                when it is shown to form a non-contradictory grasp of the full set of known facts in one’s context of
                knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a conceptual framework is shown to meet this standard, the generalizations implicit in their
                distinguishing characteristics are proven. Statements of the form “all S is P” are justified by the fact
                that P is part of what it means to be an S, and when our conceptual framework forms a non-contradictory
                grasp of all the facts, the distinguishing characteristics of those concepts form universally true
                statements (true generalizations) in our context of knowledge. Generalizations are proven by
                constructing a comprehensive conceptual framework. To achieve this, my theory provides detailed norms
                for crafting such a framework.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Inference: The Method of Going Beyond the Senses</h3>
            <p>
                I have indicated how to prove generalizations, integrations of known facts, but how do we validly
                apprehend facts to begin with? There are essentially two ways; direct observation and inference from
                direct observation. When a plastic rod is rubbed with a cloth, it will attract bits of paper. When
                scientists saw this, they concluded that the rod has a new property (charge). How did they know this?
                The rubbing is directly perceived; the rod’s new property is not. The property must be inferred—
                deduced from observations and earlier principles. Specifically, it is inferred from the principle that
                entities act in accordance with their properties, and that if an entity acts differently from others,
                it must have properties that others lack. Going further, some scientists made the hypothesis that these
                bodies contain a new kind of entity by reasoning from the principle that an entity can gain new
                properties by gaining new constituent entities. Such inferences are the first steps toward discovering
                the electron. Notice that these inferences make use of certain broad concepts like “entity,” “action,”
                “property,” and principles like, “the properties of entities are affected by their constituent
                entities.” My theory presents a clear, interconnected system of fundamental concepts and principles that
                form the foundation of inference in the sciences. These concepts enable a validation of well-known
                methods of inference such as Mill’s methods, an explication methods used implicitly in the history of
                physics, and an identification of brand new methods of inference that may have never been used before.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Certainty Through Top-Down Integration</h3>
            <p>
                To understand induction, one must understand the difference between logical inductive order
                (explained above) which proceeds “bottom-up,” and an order of integration, like that of Euclid’s
                Elements or OPAR, which proceeds “top-down.” In these works, the broadest principles (like Euclid’s 5
                postulates) are developed first, then narrower principles (like the Pythagorean theorem) are explained
                using these broader principles. These great works of integration do not constitute inductive proof in
                themselves, but are instead the crown of an inductive proof; a final step which facilitates certainty.
                In OPAR, the virtues are developed only after man’s life as the moral standard is explained, since the
                nature of virtue is a result of the proper moral standard. When concepts and their associated
                generalizations are structured in this top-down way, it allows the scientist to efficiently see every
                concept and generalization in the light of all the facts that condition it. This makes it much easier
                to form a conceptual framework which forms a non-contradictory grasp of the full set of facts in one’s
                context of knowledge, making it much easier to prove one’s generalizations. My theory gives specific
                norms for integrating one’s knowledge by constructing these top-down hierarchies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mini-header">Preview the Future</h3>
            <p>
                My ambition for this theory of induction is to enable certainty in the sciences. By following this
                procedure and meeting these standards, scientists can understand nature with more clarity and confidence
                than ever before. If discoveries achieved by a few geniuses have lifted mankind from the swamp to the
                stars in a mere 400 years, imagine what will be possible once the method of inductive certainty is just
                as common as literacy is today! To preview the current draft of A Theory of Induction, you can support
